          The new version recaptures that very livery in fact, conceived and
          developed by the Ducati Style Center, and emphasises the lightness
          and aggression of the bike with a high-impact graphics layout,
          inspired by urban graffiti and created with the same care as the
          concept from which it derives.

        <h3>YAMAHA RX 900 M</h3>

        <p>
          The Yamaha RX100 was undoubtedly one of the most iconic motorcycles to be launched in the country. This bike
          was responsible for single-handedly changing the way India travelled, while setting a benchmark for two-stroke
          bikes with its class-leading performance figures. Since its launch in 1985, it more or less ruled the
          two-wheeler market up until 1996, the year Yamaha discontinued it. The Japanese manufacturer was forced to
          pull the plug on the icon thanks to stringent emission norms enforced by the government, which spelled doom
          for all two-stroke vehicles on Indian roads.

        <p>
          The Regale has a custom headlamp, a new single-pod instrument cluster, a custom-built fuel tank with knee
          pads, custom fuel filler cap, but the handlebar, levers, and switchgear have been left stock. The front is
          highlight by a new fender with a longitudinally-mounted plate (however, the real one still resides in the
          correct place).
          Considering the Regale is a Bobber-style motorcycle, a lot of work has gone in the rear with the repositioning
          of the suspension, new tail lamp, a new single seat instead of the long stock seat. The battery box and the
          air filter have been repositioned as well. The indicators, both up front and back, are new.
